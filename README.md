Recommendation-Engine-TwitterBased
==================================

News recommendation engine based on user modeling from tweets.

System provides a framework for user modeling on Twitter which enriches the semantics of Twitter messages (tweets) and identities, topics and entities (e.g. persons, events, products) mentioned in tweets. 

We demonstrate how strategies for constructing hashtag-based, entity-based or topic-based user profiles benefit from semantic enrichment and explore the temporal dynamics of those profiles.
